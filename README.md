# JogBox
JogBox. A MPG Pendant for the Duet 2 Controller

The Duet 2 Controller was primarily designed for use with 3D printers but is becoming more popular as a controller for CNC machines. 
One of the disadvantages of the Web Based interface is that it does not suit the fine jogging requirements for CNC use. 

The JogBox connects to the PanelDue Serial port connector on the Duet 2 board and provides a rotary encoder which can be used to jog the CNC machine with the control needed. It also includes 8 buttons which, when pressed, call macros to do any user defined tasks required. 

The controller used is the Arduino Pro Mini board. This must be the 3V3 version.
